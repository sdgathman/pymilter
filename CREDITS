Jim Niemira (urmane@urmane.org) wrote the original C module and some quick
and dirty python to use it.  Stuart D. Gathman (stuart@bmsi.com) took that
kludge and added threading and context objects to it, wrote a proper OO
wrapper (Milter.py) that handles attachments, did lots of testing, packaged
it with distutils, and generally transformed it from a quick hack to a
real, usable Python extension.
